        <h1>I Love Frogs!</h1>
    <p>
        Frogs are fascinating amphibians that can be found in a variety of environments across the world. They play a crucial role in many ecosystems as both predators and prey. Their ability to live both in water and on land makes them highly adaptable to diverse habitats. Despite their small size, frogs are known for their remarkable jumping ability and unique vocalizations.

        There are thousands of frog species, each with unique characteristics. Some frogs are brightly colored, warning predators of their toxicity, while others are camouflaged to blend into their surroundings. Frogs can be found on every continent except Antarctica, and they thrive in environments ranging from tropical rainforests to arid deserts. Their lifecycle, from eggs to tadpoles to adult frogs, is one of nature's most remarkable transformations.
